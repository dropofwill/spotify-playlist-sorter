        <p>I am a Junior at RIT studying New Media Interactive Development, while also working on my minors in Free and Open Source Software and Language Science (specifically Computational Linguistics). My main interest areas are data visualization, information retrieval, and affective computing. I've done a double block coop as a primarily frontend web developer, which also involved quite a bit of Rails and UX design as well. I am currently a Research Assistant on an affective computing project where I handle the speech processing/linguistic aspect of the project.</p>

        <p>For fun I like to play basketball, snowboard, listen to music, and adjust my Vim configs. My main, but woefully outdated web site is <a href="http://will-paul.com/">will-paul.com</a>. I blog on mostly technical topics semi-frequently at <a href="http://dropofwill.herokuapp.com">dropofwill.herokuapp.com</a>. Most of my code is available to browse/use on <a href="http://github.com/dropofwill">my github (dropofwill)</a>, where you will find mostly public domain or GPL'd code as I swing back and forth on which I think is best.</p>
